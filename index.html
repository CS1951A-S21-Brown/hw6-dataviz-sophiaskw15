   <p> 1. My dashboard has three graphs, one addressing each of the 3 questions posed.  The bar chart answers question 1
       by displaying the top 10 video games by global sales for a selected year. Users can search a year in a valid range
       to update the chart to the year of their choosing and will alert the user if the year they enter does not fall in the
       valid range.The pie chart answers question 2 regarding genre sales broken down by region. It updates to display a
       specific region based on a button so the top genre by region is clearly displayed. The chart also has a tool tip
       with a dynamic stats calculation to display the percent each genre’s sales comprise of total sales for a given region.
       The chart also has legend which displays the numerical sales by genre, underlining the top selling category.
       The lollipop chart answers question 3 by displaying the video game publishers' global sales such that the top publisher
       in each genre is clearly displayed for each selected genre. It has a dropdown so the user can select a genre and update
       the chart depending on which genre sales they are interested in. All the chart titles also update so the data being
       displayed is clear.
   </p>

    2. Firstly, I found D3 to be very customizable and it allowed me display the answers to all the questions in unique and aesthetically pleasing ways. Secondly, The D3 specific functions were especially helpful in making the pie chart because there were builtins to assist in making the circle and dividing it into slices. Finally, it allowed me to make a diverse set of different charts that were tailored to the question I was trying to answer and as a result convey the data in a more readable and accessible way.

</p>

    <p>
        3. Firstly, D3 has a distinct syntax/way of creating visualizations that could be foreign to people that are used to using html/css/javascript without D3 or with another package. I have previously made done some front end development without D3and personally struggled somewhat with adapting to D3. Secondly, D3 is pretty fundamental and rudimentary which makes it great for handling simpler charts but not necessarily the best choice for more complicated or involved charts like maps.
        Thirdly, there are other libraries that handling a lot more of the complexities that D3 requires the developer to code out so those libraries may be better for making dashboards that are very accessible where the developer wants to focus more attention on perfecting the final visualization and less on writing intricate code.

        4. As the articles point out, there are many ways that the inaccessibility of technology to certain groups can go
        overlooked by the people that develop it. Both readings mention color blindness and vision impairment. In choosing
        my color scheme, I ran my palettes through a color blindness checker to ensure the colors, particularly of the pie
        chart, were still well differentiated so ideally color blind users would find my dashboard accessible. However, the
        betterment .com article highlights the importance of making data visualization dashboard accessible to those with low
        vision or no vision. Since the text is relatively small and there is very little information that could be read out
        loud, including a tooltip, this dashboard would not be very accessible to those that need the help of assistive technologies.
        I would take steps to make this dashboard more accessible by adding detailed descriptions to my charts that could be used by assistive
        technologies to ensure users with low or no vision can still access the information displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
        5. There were two main factors that kept me from taking additional steps. Firstly, my own lack of experience in javascript at times held me back from implementing more accessibility features because I struggled to implement them. For example, the betterment.com article mentions how labels should be attached to charts rather than in a legend but I personally could not figure out a way to do this on my graph without it looking cluttered and arguably less accessible so I used a legend. Secondly, at times I got too caught up in the process making graphs look “cool” or “pretty” that I failed to take into account how those features that I find “cool” could be inaccessible. For example,  the medium.com article mentions accommodations in data visualization for those with epilepsy, ADHD and cognitive disabilities. While I may have thought that the way my charts transition when a button is clicked is an interesting feature, I failed to take into account that this may be distracting or even harmful for those with epilepsy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Extra credit stats calculation: On the pie chart, I calculated the percentage sales that each genre comprises of total sales. This percentage is displayed on the tooltip and
        updates when the user hovers over a different element of the pie chart/when the chart is updated to display a different region. To calculate, I divided the total sales for a given genre by the total sales for all genres in a given region.
